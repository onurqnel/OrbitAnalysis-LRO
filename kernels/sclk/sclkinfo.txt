General Information About SPICE SCL-Kernels
===========================================

   In the SPICE system, Spacecraft Clock (or SCL) -kernel contains a
   set of information required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK).
   
   The spacecraft clock coefficient information contained in SCLK file
   can be manipulated using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to which can
   be integrated into user application programs. The information
   regarding how to obtain the SPICE system toolkit for a number of
   languages and computer platforms is located in the ``/software''
   subdirectory of the main directory of this data set.
   
   Refer to the ``sclk.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about conversion between ET and spacecraft clock
   times.


LRO SCL-kernels Contained in This Data Set
==========================================

   The SCLK kernel will be cumulative file for the entire mission.
   During the prime mission phase, the clock on board the LRO
   orbiter should be accurate enough that it should never need
   adjustment baring some anomaly or Orbiter reset, or leap-second
   adjustment.

   Clock correlation will be performed approximately twice per day
   during ground station passes that provide support for the activity.
   Clock correlation is scheduled and run via a Command and Telemetry
   procedure during these passes. Nominally, the SCLK kernel will be
   updated with an entry for each clock correlation activity.

   File duration:         NA; file represents historical concepts for
                          all clock correlations

   File or Data
   Generation Frequency:  As needed

   Data Volume:           Variable; based on number of LRO clock
                          correlation activities and will increase
                          throughout the mission.

   Accuracy 
   (if it applies):       Time accurate to 1 second.

   File Name Convention
   --------------------

   The LRO on-board clock SCLK files included in the data set shall be
   named according to the following naming scheme:
 
   <File Designator>_<Creation Date>_<Version>.<File Extension>

   where

   File Designator = [10 characters] token identifying the file; is
                     "lro_clkcor" for LRO on-board clock SCLK files.

   Creation Date   = [7 characters], file creation date in DOY form,
                     YYYYDOY;
                     where
                     YYYY => 4 ASCII digits of year ("2008"-"2013")
                     DOY => 3 ASCII digits for day of year ("001"-"366").

   Version         = [3 characters] file version, vNN; 
                     where
                     NN => a two-digit version number; the initial version
                     is "00", next is "01" ... up to "99".

   File Extension  = [3characters] Standard file extension for a text SCLK
                     file "tsc".

   The following is an example of an LRO on-board clock SCLK file name:
     - LRO on-board clock SCLK File:  lro_clkcor_2009015_v01.tsc
