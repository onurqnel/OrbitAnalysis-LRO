LRO LS-Kernels 
==============

   The SPICE Leap Second File is a generic SPICE product that LRO
   receives from the NAIF/PDS repository. This file will be included
   whenever the NAIF releases a new version.  This logical product
   actually consist of two separate files based on the user's platform;
   the file contains all of the leap second adjustments and when these
   adjustments should be used.  This file supports the conversion between
   ephemeris time and UTC.

   Time interval:         NA; the file contains the specific times at
                          which a leap-second is applied.

   File duration:         NA.

   File or Data
   Generation Frequency:  Regenerated, as identified by NAIF personnel.

   Data Volume:           Variable.

   Accuracy
   (if it applies):         Associated UTC time corresponding to the
                           Leap-second is accurate to milliseconds.


   File Name Convention
   --------------------
   The generic LSK files included in the data set shall be named according
   to the following naming scheme:

   <File Name>.<File Extension>

   where

   File Name      = [8 characters] file name; is "naifNNNN" for generic
                    LSK files
                    where
                    NNNN is the version number

   File Extension = [3 characters] standard file extension for a text LSK
                    file "tls".

   The following is an example of a LSK file name:
     - Generic LSK file:    naif0009.tls
