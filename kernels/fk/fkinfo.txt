General Information About SPICE Frames Kernels
==============================================

   In the SPICE system, FRAMES kernel contains a set of information
   required to define various frames used in a particular mission,
   sources of orientation and origin location information for these
   frames and inter-connections between these frames and other frames
   supported within the SPICE system.

   The frame definitions information contained in the file can be
   utilized in conjunction with other data using the SPICE Toolkit
   APIs, calls to which can be integrated into user application
   programs. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system
   toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is located
   in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data
   set.

   Refer to the ``frames.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about definition and usage of the frames within the
   SPICE system.


LRO Frames Kernels Contained in This Data Set
=============================================

   The following Frames Kernel files are included in this data set (only
   name portion of the file name is shown; the extension of all FK file
   names is ``.tf''):

      lro_frames_YYYYDOY_vNN       LRO Mission FK files containing the
                                   complete set of frame definitions
                                   for the spacecraft, the solar array,
                                   and high gain antenna and as well as
                                   the definitions of the base
                                   instrument frames incorporating
                                   instrument mounting alignments.
                                   YYYYDOY in the file name identifies
                                   the file release date; NN identifies
                                   the file version.

      lro_INST_frames_YYYYDOY_vNN  LRO instrument FK files containing
                                   definitions of additional frames
                                   needed to compute observation
                                   geometry for a particular
                                   instrument. INST in the file name
                                   identifies the instrument (crater,
                                   dlre, lamp, lola, lend, or lroc);
                                   YYYYDOY identifies the file release
                                   date; NN identifies the file
                                   version.

      moon_080317                  Lunar Reference Frames FK file
                                   specifying lunar body-fixed reference
                                   frames -- ``Mean Earth'' (ME) and
                                   ``Principal Axis'' (PA) frames --
                                   associated with high-accuracy lunar
                                   orientation data provided by the JPL
                                   Solar System Dynamics Group's
                                   planetary ephemerides DE421.

      moon_assoc_me                Lunar Reference Frame Associations
      moon_assoc_pa                FK files are used to associate
                                   either ME or PA frame with the
                                   Moon. Only one of these kernels needs
                                   to be loaded at a time in order for
                                   some older SPICE APIs to perform
                                   computations in that frame. Neither
                                   of these kernels is needed for the
                                   latest SPICE APIs.

   If more than one FK of a particular kind is present in this
   directory, the FK with the latest release date and version
   supersedes all FKs with earlier release dates and versions.
