General Information About SPICE PC-Kernels
==========================================

   In the SPICE system, the PC-kernels contain planetary attitude and
   body shape information. The PCK kernel includes orientation and
   shape information pertaining to extended solar system bodies such as
   the Sun, the planets, the natural satellites of the planets, comets,
   and asteroids.

   The purpose of the PCK kernels and associated software is to provide
   SPICE users with a convenient mechanism for supplying planetary
   physical constants to application programs. SPICE's PCK software is
   able to read files conforming to the PCK format and return to a
   calling application program both the data contained in such files
   and a small number of commonly used numeric quantities derived from
   the kernel data. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE
   system toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is
   located in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of
   this data set.

   Refer to the ``pck.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information on how to access PC-kernel data.

   File Name Convention
   --------------------

   The High Precision Lunar Orientation binary PCK files included in the
   data set shall be named according to the following naming scheme:

   <File Designator>_<DE ID>_<Start Year>_<Stop Year>.<File Extension>

   where

   File Designator = [7 characters] token identifying the file; is
                     "moon_pa" for High Precision Lunar Orientation
                     binary PCK files providing orientation for the
                     Principal Axes frame.

   DE ID           = [5 characters] id of the planetary DE solution from
                     which the orientation data was obtained;
                     where
                     "deNNN" where NNN is the numeric ID of the DE solution.

   Start Year      = [4 characters]; file coverage start year, YYYY;
                     where
                     YYYY => 4 ASCII digits of year.

   Stop Year       = [4 characters]; file coverage stop year, YYYY;
                     where
                     YYYY => 4 ASCII digits of year.

   File Extension  = [3 characters] standard file extension for a binary
                     PCK file "bpc".

   The generic text PCK files included in the data set shall be named
   according to the following naming scheme:

   <File Name>.<File Extension>

   where

   File Name      = [8 characters] file name; is "pckNNNNN" for generic
                    PCK files where NNNNN is the version number.

   File Extension = [3 characters] standard file extension for a text
                    PCK file "tpc".

   The LRO-specific lunar shape/size text PCK files included in the data
   set shall be named according to the following naming scheme:

   <File Designator>_<Creation Date>_<Version>.<File Extension>

   where

   File Designator = [12 characters] token identifying the file; is
                     "lro_lunarpck" for LRO-specific Lunar shape/size
                     PCK files.

   Creation Date   = [7 characters], file creation date in DOY form,
                     YYYYDOY;
                     where
                     YYYY => 4 ASCII digits of year ("2008"-"2013")
                     DOY => 3 ASCII digits for day of year ("001"-"366").

   Version         = [3 characters] file version, vNN;
                     where
                     NN => a two-digit version number; the initial version
                     is "00", next is "01" ... up to "99".

   File Extension  = [3 characters] Standard file extension for a text
                     PCK file "tpc".

   The following are examples of PCK file names:
     - Lunar Orientation binary PCK files:  moon_pa_de418_1950_2050.bpc
     - Generic text PCK file             :  pck00008.tpc
     - LRO-specific lunar text PCK files :  lro_lunarpck_2009012_v01.tpc


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in a text PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

   The most detailed description of the data in a binary PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using utility programs COMMNT and
   SPACIT included into the NAIF Toolkit.
